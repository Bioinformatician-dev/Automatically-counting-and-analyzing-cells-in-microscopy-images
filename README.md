# Automatically-counting-and-analyzing-cells-in-microscopy-images
Develop a system to automatically count and analyze cells in microscopy images.

## Approach:
Use image segmentation techniques to isolate individual cells.
Apply contour detection to count and characterize cell shapes.
Visualize the results with bounding boxes or annotations.

## Installation
# Setup and Libraries
Make sure you have OpenCV installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```
